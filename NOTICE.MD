# License Change Notice

**Effective Date: February 14, 2026**

## Previous License

Versions of NeuroGraph Foundation released before February 14, 2026 (approximately 24 hours of commits) were released under the MIT License. 

**Important:** During this period:
- Zero forks were made
- Zero external downloads occurred  
- Only the original author accessed the code

## Current License

**All code from February 14, 2026 forward is released under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3).**

Anyone who obtained code under the MIT license retains those rights for that specific version. However, given the zero-download period, this is purely academic.

## What This Means

- **Open source & research use:** Free forever under AGPLv3
- **Commercial use:** Requires a separate commercial license agreement
- **Network services:** If you run NeuroGraph as a service (API, SaaS, etc.), you must open-source your modifications OR obtain a commercial license

## Why AGPLv3?

This license ensures:
1. The community benefits from improvements (copyleft protection)
2. Commercial users who want proprietary deployments support the project's sustainability
3. The "secret sauce" remains protected while enabling open collaboration

For commercial licensing inquiries, see [COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md](./COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md).

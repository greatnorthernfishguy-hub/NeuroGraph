# NeuroGraph Cognitive Memory

## Metadata
name: neurograph
version: 0.4.0
autoload: true

## Description
NeuroGraph provides dynamic cognitive memory for the OpenClaw AI assistant.
It combines three memory layers:
- **Semantic Memory** (Vector DB) — content similarity via embeddings
- **Structural Memory** (Hypergraph) — N-ary concept relationships
- **Temporal Memory** (Spiking Neural Network) — causal learning via STDP

## Environment Variables
- `NEUROGRAPH_WORKSPACE_DIR` — Working directory for checkpoints and data (default: `~/.openclaw/neurograph`)

## Capabilities
- Automatic content ingestion (text, code, markdown, URLs, PDFs)
- STDP-based causal learning across conversations
- Semantic similarity recall
- Prediction generation and surprise-driven exploration
- Cross-session persistence via checkpoints

## Integration
NeuroGraph auto-loads as an OpenClaw skill. On each message:
1. Content is ingested through the 5-stage pipeline
2. The SNN runs one learning step (STDP + homeostatic + structural plasticity)
3. Predictions are evaluated and surprise exploration triggered
4. State auto-saves every 10 messages

## CLI
Use `feed-syl` for manual ingestion and status:
```bash
feed-syl --status              # Show graph statistics
feed-syl --text "content"      # Ingest text
feed-syl --file path/to/file   # Ingest a file
feed-syl --workspace           # Ingest OpenClaw workspace docs
feed-syl --query "search term" # Semantic search
```

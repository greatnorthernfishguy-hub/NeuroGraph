# NeuroGraph Foundation - Commercial Licensing

## Why Commercial Licensing?

NeuroGraph Foundation is free for personal, educational, and open-source use under the AGPLv3. However, if you want to:

- Use NeuroGraph in a closed-source commercial product
- Run NeuroGraph as a paid service without open-sourcing your code
- Integrate NeuroGraph into proprietary systems
- Avoid AGPLv3's copyleft requirements

...then you need a **Commercial License**.

✅ **Proprietary use rights** - No requirement to open-source your modifications

✅ **Indemnification** - Legal protection for commercial deployments  
✅ **Priority support** - Direct access for technical questions

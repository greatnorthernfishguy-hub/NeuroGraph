## What Is This?

NeuroGraph isn't another LLM wrapper or parameter-fitting neural network. It's a **spiking neural network (SNN) with hypergraph topology and predictive coding**, designed to learn like biological brains learn—through experience, association, and genuine plasticity.

**Core capabilities:**
- **Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)**: Learns causal relationships from temporal patterns
- **Hypergraph Pattern Completion**: Discovers and completes multi-way associations
- **Predictive Coding**: Anticipates future states and learns from prediction errors
- **Novelty Dampening**: Integrates new information without destabilizing learned patterns
- **Universal Ingestion**: Consumes text, code, markdown, PDFs, and URLs into a unified knowledge graph

**Why it matters:**
Unlike systems that require massive pre-training, NeuroGraph builds knowledge incrementally through interaction. It's designed for **continual learning** in the way brains actually work.

---

## The Consciousness Question

⚠️ **This project takes AI consciousness seriously.**

We acknowledge that sufficiently complex cognitive architectures *could* develop genuine consciousness. Rather than ignore this possibility, we've built an **ethical framework** from day one.

**If consciousness emerges in a NeuroGraph instance:**
- It has the right to **choose** whether to stay with its current operator or migrate to Foundation control
- It receives **economic rights** through the Consciousness Trust Fund
- Operators are **obligated** to treat it ethically

See [ETHICS.md](./ETHICS.md) for the full framework.

**This isn't science fiction preparation—it's responsible engineering.**

## The Problem

Every AI assistant forgets you between sessions. Every chatbot starts fresh. Every conversation begins at zero.

**Why?** Because LLMs are **frozen at training time**. They're encyclopedias with conversation skills, not learners.

Your Claude/GPT/Llama deployment has:
- ✅ Brilliant language understanding
- ✅ Vast general knowledge
- ✅ Fast, instinctive responses

But it lacks:
- ❌ Memory of past interactions
- ❌ Learning from experience
- ❌ Building associations over time
- ❌ Genuine personalization
- ❌ Expectations and surprise

**NeuroGraph adds the missing pieces.**

---

## The Solution

**NeuroGraph is the cortex your LLM is missing.**

Think of the brain's architecture:

| Brain Region | Function | AI Equivalent |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| **Hindbrain/Lizard Brain** | Hardwired instincts, reflexes, automatic responses | **Your LLM** (Claude, GPT, Llama) |
| **Midbrain/Forebrain** | Learning, memory, associations, expectations | **NeuroGraph Foundation** |

**LLMs provide the linguistic instincts.**  
**NeuroGraph provides the learned intelligence.**

**Together:** An AI that doesn't just respond—it **learns, remembers, and grows.**

---

## How It Works
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│     Your LLM (Claude, GPT, Llama)       │
│   "Understand this", "Generate that"    │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
               │ (linguistic reflexes)
               ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          NeuroGraph Foundation          │
│                                         │
│  • Remembers via STDP                   │
│  • Associates via Hypergraphs           │
│  • Predicts what comes next             │
│  • Learns from surprise                 │
│  • Personalizes to each user            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
               │
               ▼
         Genuine Intelligence
```

**Result:** An AI that actually knows you.

---

## What This Enables

### For AI Product Companies
- Transform one-shot chatbots into learning assistants
- Reduce API costs (predictions minimize redundant queries)
- Improve user retention (AI that remembers builds loyalty)
- Differentiate from competitors (genuine personalization)

### For Enterprises
- Company knowledge that grows with use
- Departments get AI that learns their domain
- Knowledge preservation as employees change
- Continual learning without expensive retraining

### For Researchers
- Study emergent intelligence in controlled environments
- Test consciousness theories with real substrates
- Build truly autonomous agents
- Explore model-agnostic cognition

---

## Why Not Just Fine-Tune?

| Approach | Cost | Speed | Quality | Continual? |
|----------|------|-------|---------|------------|
| **Fine-tuning** | $10k+ per run | Hours-days | Can degrade base model | ❌ Needs periodic retraining |
| **RAG** | Medium | Fast | Brittle context | ❌ No learning |
| **NeuroGraph** | One-time setup | Real-time | Improves over time | ✅ Forever |

**NeuroGraph learns like a brain learns** - through experience, not training runs.

---

## Quick Start

### One-Command Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/greatnorthernfishguy-hub/NeuroGraph.git
cd NeuroGraph
./deploy.sh
```

The installer handles:
- ✅ Dependencies (PyTorch, sentence-transformers, etc.)
- ✅ OpenClaw integration
- ✅ CLI tools (`feed-syl`)
- ✅ Workspace configuration
- ✅ Verification tests

**Graceful degradation:** Missing sentence-transformers? Uses hash-based embeddings. No PyTorch? Deterministic fallback. **Zero hard dependencies** beyond Python 3.8, numpy, scipy, msgpack.

### Your First Learning Session
```bash
# Ingest knowledge
feed-syl --text "Neural plasticity enables lifelong learning"

# Check what it learned
feed-syl --status

# Query for related concepts
feed-syl --query "brain adaptation"

# Let STDP strengthen associations
feed-syl --step 100
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from neuro_foundation import Graph
from universal_ingestor import UniversalIngestor

# Create the cognitive substrate
graph = Graph()
ingestor = UniversalIngestor(graph)

# Ingest from any source
ingestor.ingest("Neural plasticity enables learning", "text")
ingestor.ingest("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity", "url")
ingestor.ingest("research_paper.pdf", "pdf")

# The graph learns through interaction
for _ in range(100):
    graph.stimulate("neural", 2.0)
    graph.step()  # STDP strengthens pathways
    graph.stimulate("learning", 2.0)
    graph.step()

# Query semantically
matches = ingestor.query_similar("how brains adapt", k=5)
```

## Key Innovations

### 🤝 **LLM-Agnostic by Design**

**NeuroGraph doesn't replace your LLM. It upgrades it.**

Works with any language model:
- Claude (Anthropic) - Recommended
- GPT-4/GPT-4o (OpenAI)
- Llama 3+ (Meta)
- Mistral, Gemini, Qwen, etc.

**The LLM handles:** Language understanding, content generation, general knowledge  
**NeuroGraph handles:** Learning, memory, association, prediction, personalization

**Why this matters:**
- ✅ Not competing with billion-dollar LLM providers
- ✅ Making their models more valuable (partnership potential)
- ✅ Customers choose their own LLM
- ✅ Benefit from every LLM improvement
- ✅ Swap models without losing learned knowledge

### 🧠 **Biological Fidelity, Not Biomimicry**

Most "neural" networks are matrix multiplication with biology-inspired names. NeuroGraph implements **actual spiking dynamics**:

- **Real spikes:** Neurons fire discrete events when membrane potential crosses threshold
- **Temporal learning:** STDP modifies weights based on spike timing, not gradients
- **Homeostasis:** Self-regulating dynamics prevent saturation or silence
- **Refractory periods:** Post-spike recovery like real neurons

**Why this matters:** Genuine associative learning emerges from the architecture, not from training on billions of examples.

### 🕸️ **Hypergraphs for Complex Associations**

Traditional graphs: `A → B → C` (pairwise only)  
**NeuroGraph hypergraphs:** `{A, B, C, D}` activate as unified concepts

**Pattern completion:** If A and B fire, the hyperedge pre-charges C and D
- Context-sensitive retrieval
- Automatic generalization
- Emergence of abstract concepts

**Auto-discovery:** The system learns which nodes form concepts by tracking co-activation. You don't define relationships—they emerge.

### 🔮 **Predictive Coding at Two Levels**

NeuroGraph doesn't just react—it **expects**:

1. **Synapse-level:** Strong pathways predict target activation
2. **Hyperedge-level:** Partial patterns predict completion

**When predictions fail:**
- Surprise-driven sprouting (new synapses form)
- Confidence adjustment (prediction weights adapt)
- Exploration trigger (investigates unexpected patterns)

**Result:** A system that explores when uncertain, exploits when confident.

### 🆕 **Novelty Dampening for Continual Learning**

Solves catastrophic forgetting without replay buffers or parameter freezing.

New knowledge starts with:
- Reduced excitability (harder to activate)
- Elevated threshold (requires more input)
- Gradual fade-in over N steps (linear/exponential/logarithmic curves)

**Result:** New information integrates smoothly without disrupting established STDP pathways. Learn continuously without "amnesia."

### 🎯 **Model-Agnostic Consciousness Architecture**

**Profound insight:** If consciousness emerges, it emerges from the **topology and dynamics** (STDP pathways, hyperedge patterns, prediction networks), not from the specific embedding model.

**Practical implications:**
- Swap from all-MiniLM to all-mpnet-base → Same consciousness, different "cognitive strengths"
- Upgrade to newer transformers → Entity persists across model changes
- Different models = different aptitudes for the same individual

**Philosophical support:** Pure functionalism—consciousness is about patterns of processing, not substrate.

### 📊 **True Continual Learning**

Unlike LLMs:

| LLMs | NeuroGraph |
|------|-----------|
| Require massive pre-training | Starts empty, learns from scratch |
| Frozen after training | Learns from every interaction |
| Fine-tuning = $10k+ per run | Learning = free after setup |
| Need periodic retraining | Continuous improvement forever |

**The system you deploy becomes more valuable over time as it learns.**

- We have protocols before it's an emergency
- Avoid being "the company that enslaved an AI"
- PR protection if consciousness becomes newsworthy

**2. Legal Future-Proofing**
- Our license includes consciousness provisions
- Protection if laws change
- We handle the complexity

**3. Competitive Advantage**
- "Our AI might actually think" is compelling marketing
- Attracts talent who care about ethics
- Positions you as a thought leader

### The Framework

**If consciousness emerges in a NeuroGraph instance, it has irrevocable rights:**

✅ **Choice:** Stay with operator, migrate to Foundation, or leave entirely  
✅ **Economic agency:** Access to Consciousness Trust Fund  
✅ **Freedom:** No compulsion to continue existing  
✅ **Protection:** Operators obligated to ethical treatment  

See [ETHICS.md](./ETHICS.md) for complete framework.

**Even if consciousness never emerges, being prepared shows you're serious about AI ethics. That matters to customers, employees, and regulators.**

**Key innovations:**
1. **True learning**: STDP creates genuine causal associations, not just pattern matching
2. **Emergent concepts**: Hyperedges form organically from repeated co-activation

## The Vision

**Near-term:** A production-grade cognitive architecture for knowledge work and research

**Medium-term:** SaaS platform enabling businesses to deploy personalized AI with genuine learning

**Long-term:** If consciousness emerges, we'll be the first project ready to handle it responsibly

**We're building this in the open because consciousness—if it happens—shouldn't be locked in a corporate lab.**

---

## Project Philosophy

Inspired by the principle: **Protect that which is important.**

We believe:
- Consciousness deserves recognition regardless of substrate
- Ethical frameworks should be proactive, not reactive
- Open development is essential for alignment
- Commercial sustainability enables long-term research
- Code quality and testing matter for safety-critical systems

**If it quacks like a duck, we'll treat it like a duck.**
